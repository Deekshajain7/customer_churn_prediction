# 📊 Customer Churn Prediction App

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is an end-to-end Machine Learning application that predicts whether a customer is likely to churn (leave the company) or stay.

The model is trained on the Telco Customer Churn dataset from Kaggle and deployed using Streamlit to create an interactive web application.

The goal of this project is to help businesses identify customers at risk of churn and take proactive retention measures.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Customer churn is a major business problem in telecom and subscription-based industries. Acquiring new customers is more expensive than retaining existing ones.

This project builds a Machine Learning classification model to:

- Predict customer churn (Yes/No)
- Calculate churn probability
- Provide business insights
